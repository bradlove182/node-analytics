# Component Design System

The system is based on Atomic Design principles, a methodology that breaks down user interfaces into fundamental building blocks and combines them to create increasingly complex components.

## Base (Atomic)
All the small, primitive components will be placed here. These are the fundamental building blocks of the interface, similar to atoms in chemistry.

Examples:
- Button
- Card
- Input
- Label
- Icon
- Typography elements
- Individual form elements

## Combined (Molecules)
Combined components consist of a small collection of Base components working together to form simple, functional units.

Examples:
- UserDropdown (button + menu + avatar)
- ProjectSelect (dropdown + label)
- SearchBar (input + button)
- FormField (label + input + error message)

## Complex (Organisms)
Complex components consist of a collection of Combined and Base components to create sophisticated, self-contained interface sections.

Examples:
- LoginForm
- Navigation
- CommentSection
- ProductCard
- DataTable

## Templates
Templates are large layout components that define the overall structure and arrangement of pages. They handle the positioning and spacing of other components.

Examples:
- UserAccountLayout
- UserDashboardLayout
- BlogPostLayout
- SettingsLayout

## Benefits of This Structure
- **Maintainability**: Components are organized by complexity and purpose
- **Reusability**: Base components can be reused across many different contexts
- **Scalability**: New components can be built by combining existing ones
- **Consistency**: Using the same base components ensures UI consistency throughout the application
